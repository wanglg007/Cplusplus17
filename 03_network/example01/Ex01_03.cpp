/**
 * In Boost.Asio a passive socket is represented by the asio::ip::tcp::acceptor class.The name of the class suggests the
 * key function of the objects of the classâ€”to listen for and accept or handle incoming connection requests.The following
 * algorithm describes the steps required to perform to create an acceptor socket:
 * (1) Create an instance of the asio::io_service class or use the one that has been created earlier.
 * (2) Create an object of the asio::ip::tcp class that represents the TCP protocol and the required version of the
 * underlying IP protocol (IPv4 or IPv6).
 * (3) Create an object of the asio::ip::tcp::acceptor class representing an acceptor socket, passing the object of the
 * asio::io_service class to its constructor.
 * (4) Call the acceptor socket's open() method, passing the object representing the protocol created in step 2 as an argument.
